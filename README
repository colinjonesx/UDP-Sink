This project simply creates a node.js handler that listens on a UDP socket
recieves packets from any source and writes them to a SQLite DB.

N.B. This is a learning project for me, there maybe poor practice and bugs
while I get to grips with node.js and associated technologies.

Provisional UDP-message Format
------------------------------
pipe delimited stream as below
{msg.length}|{HOSTNAME}|{TS}|{TYPE}|{DATA}

{msg.length} = integer
{HOSTNAME} = string
{TS} = integer, source event time milliseconsds since epoch
{TYPE} = string, type of message
{DATA} = string, JSON
